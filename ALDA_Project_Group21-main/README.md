## Dataset Description
We are using the Mpox Skin Lesion Dataset (version 2.0) from Kaggle, which contains images of skin lesions potentially caused by Mpox.  MSLD v2.0 features a collection of images categorized into six classes: Mpox (284 images), Chickenpox (75 images), Measles (55 images), Cowpox (66 images), Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) (161 images), and Healthy (114 images). This dataset comprises a total of 755 original skin lesion images collected from 541 unique patients, providing a well-rounded sample. Notably, professional dermatologists have endorsed this latest version, which has also received approval from relevant regulatory authorities.
However, due to the datasetâ€™s relatively small size, we plan to extend it by integrating images from other relevant datasets or by performing data augmentation. This combined dataset will undergo various data augmentation and GANN techniques, such as rotation, translation, reflection, shear, hue, saturation, contrast, brightness jitter, noise, and scaling to ensure sufficient data for model training and to address potential issues like overfitting.
